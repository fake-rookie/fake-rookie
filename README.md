## Some View of `FP`

  I like `Functional Programming Language`. e.g. `Scheme`, `Haskell`, `OCaml`.
  
  Had a Good Theory both of `Haskell` & `OCaml`.
  
  `Haskell` has more **simply** & **clearly** syntax than `OCaml`.
  
  But the `stack` & `cabal` more `SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK` than `opam`
